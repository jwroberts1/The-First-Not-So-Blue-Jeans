                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Passage:</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">The story of the Frisbee begins not with a plastic disc, but with a simple pie tin. In the late 1800s, a man named William Russell Frisbie started a bakery in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His business, the Frisbie Pie Company, quickly became famous for its delicious pies. University students from nearby Yale and other schools were some of his best customers. After they finished eating the pies, they would often take the empty tin plates and toss them around for a game of catch. The light, round shape of the tins made them perfect for gliding through the air. As a fun warning, they would yell out "Frisbie!" to anyone in the way. This playful tradition became a part of campus life and was the very humble beginning of a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Years later, in the late 1940s, a man named Walter "Fred" Morrison saw people tossing around a popcorn tin lid on a California beach. He had an idea to create a better, more perfect flying disc. He and his partner, Warren Franscioni, designed a plastic version they called the "Flyin' Saucer." This was an exciting time when people were fascinated by stories of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and flying saucers. The toy was made of a brittle plastic that would often crack and break when it hit something hard. They sold their invention at county fairs, but people wanted something more durable. The "Flyin' Saucer" was a novel idea but had some obvious flaws.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Morrison continued to work on his design, making the disc thicker and more flexible. In 1957, he sold his updated model to the Wham-O toy company. Wham-O was a small but clever company known for making fun toys like the Hula Hoop. Richard Knerr, one of the founders of Wham-O, loved the flying disc but disliked the name. He had heard about the students who used to throw the pie tins and decided to call the toy the **Frisbee**. This new name, which honored the old pie tins, was a huge success.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Wham-O's team, led by inventor Ed Headrick, was tasked with making the Frisbee fly even better. He studied the way it moved through the air and came up with a simple but brilliant idea. He added a series of rings to the top of the disc. These rings, which came to be known as the "Headrick Rings," were a key innovation that improved the disc's aerodynamics. They allowed the disc to fly with remarkable stability and accuracy. Thanks to these improvements, the Frisbee became a popular outdoor pastime for millions of people worldwide, and it even led to the creation of competitive sports like Ultimate Frisbee. Today, people still enjoy this fun pastime in parks, on beaches, and in their own backyards.</p>
